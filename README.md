# Diabetes-Prediction

### Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. There isnâ€™t a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active can really help in reducing the impact of diabetes. This Web app will help you to predict whether a person has diabetes by analysing the values of several features using the Random forest algorithm.
